                    I worked under <a href="https://gwtokarsky.github.io">Professor George Tokarsky</a> on unilluminable rooms.

                    The user can create a valid polygonal room of their choice and see the animated path of light as it avoids the unilluminable points. 
                    I also worked on several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgR1FKKRkc">videos</a> to demonstrate the applications, which got over 10,000 views combined.

                    This is the most intense course I have ever taken. From the start of the semester I was constantly learning, and I enjoyed it a lot.
                    I gained experience writing a lot of C++ code. I also gained experience reviewing other people's code and working in a team using sprint planning.
                    I gained an understanding of how compilers work, and implemented a front-end for a language called Gazprea to LLVM IR. 
                    The basic process is as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parse the code in a given language to generate the parse tree (or abstract syntax tree). Any syntax errors can be caught here</li>
                        <li>Define the scopes and symbols for the variables in the program. Any errors related to scoping can be caught here.</li>
                        <li>Define the type of each symbol defined in the scope tree. Any errors related to misusing types can be caught here.</li>
                        <li>Check for any semantic errors.</li>
                        <li>Go through the abstract syntax tree and do code emission. In our case we generated LLVM IR.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    From there on, the LLVM IR can be converted into any assembly level backend. There are also compiler optimizations that can be performed here,
                    but I only learnt about the theory behind it, we didn't implement it.
