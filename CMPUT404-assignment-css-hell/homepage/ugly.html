                    I help students understand and debug C++ and Python code during office hours, and help them understand course concepts.
                    I am also part of the team that marks assignments.

                    I worked under <a href="https://gwtokarsky.github.io">Professor George Tokarsky</a> on unilluminable rooms. 
                    I created desktop applications to visualize the path of light in polygonal shaped rooms. 
                    The user can create a valid polygonal room of their choice and see the animated path of light as it avoids the unilluminable points. 
                    I also worked on several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgR1FKKRkc">videos</a> to demonstrate the applications, which got over 10,000 views combined.

                <p class="coursetext">
                    This is the most intense course I have ever taken. From the start of the semester I was constantly learning, and I enjoyed it a lot.
                    I gained experience writing a lot of C++ code. I also gained experience reviewing other people's code and working in a team using sprint planning.
                    I gained an understanding of how compilers work, and implemented a front-end for a language called Gazprea to LLVM IR. 
                    The basic process is as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parse the code in a given language to generate the parse tree (or abstract syntax tree). Any syntax errors can be caught here</li>
                        <li>Define the scopes and symbols for the variables in the program. Any errors related to scoping can be caught here.</li>
                        <li>Define the type of each symbol defined in the scope tree. Any errors related to misusing types can be caught here.</li>
                        <li>Check for any semantic errors.</li>
                        <li>Go through the abstract syntax tree and do code emission. In our case we generated LLVM IR.</li>
                    </ul>

                    From there on, the LLVM IR can be converted into any assembly level backend. There are also compiler optimizations that can be performed here,
                    but I only learnt about the theory behind it, we didn't implement it.

                    I'm currently taking this course. I'm learning a lot about the web, and software development. I'm getting experience working with React, Django
                    and Javascript. I'm also getting experience doing code reviews and ticket management.

                    This was one of my favourite courses. I learnt a lot of algorithms for solving different problems, like dynamic programming,
                    graph theory, number theory and linear programming.
